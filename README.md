# drivel

`drivel` is a command-line tool written in Rust for inferring a schema from an example JSON (or JSON lines) file, and generating synthetic data (the drivel in question) 
based on the inferred schema.

## Features

- **Schema Inference**: drivel can analyze JSON input and infer its schema, including data types, array lengths, and object structures.
- **Data Generation**: Based on the inferred schema, drivel can generate synthetic data that adheres to the inferred structure.
- **Easy to integrate**: drivel reads JSON input from stdin and writes its output to stdout, allowing for easy integration into pipelines and workflows.

## Installation

To install the drivel executable, ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed and run:

```sh
cargo install drivel
```

To add drivel as a dependency to your project, e.g., to use the schema inference engine, run:

```sh
cargo add drivel
```

## Usage

### Describe Mode

In 'describe' mode, drivel infers the schema from the input JSON and prints a human-readable description of the schema. This mode is useful for understanding the structure and data types present in JSON data.

```sh
cat input.json | drivel describe
```

### Produce Mode

In 'produce' mode, drivel infers the schema from the input JSON, generates synthetic data based on the inferred schema, and outputs the generated data in JSON format. This is useful for generating test data or sample datasets.

At present, drivel is moderately smart about schema inference. It makes some attempt at inferring semantic meaning for fields, particularly for String types,
but it is fairly limited at doing this. I would welcome any work to improve drivel's ability to understand the data it sees, to have more semantic understanding baked into the generated schema.

```sh
cat input.json | drivel produce
```

You can also specify the number of times to repeat the generated data:

```sh
cat input.json | drivel produce 5
```

## Examples

Consider a JSON file `input.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "id": "0e3a99a5-0201-4444-9ab1-8343fac56233",
  "age": 30,
  "is_student": false,
  "grades": [85, 90, 78],
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip_code": "10001"
  }
}
```

Running drivel in 'describe' mode:

```sh
cat input.json | drivel describe
```

Output:

```
{
  "age": int (30),
  "address": {
    "city": string (8),
    "zip_code": string (5)
  },
  "is_student": boolean,
  "grades": [
    int (78-90)
  ] (3),
  "name": string (8),
  "id": string (uuid)
}
```

Running drivel in 'produce' mode:

```sh
cat input.json | drivel produce 3
```

Output:

```json
[
  {
    "address": {
      "city": "o oowrYN",
      "zip_code": "01110"
    },
    "age": 30,
    "grades": [83, 88, 88],
    "is_student": true,
    "name": "nJ heo D",
    "id": "9e0a7687-800d-404b-835f-e7d803b60380"
  },
  {
    "address": {
      "city": "oro wwNN",
      "zip_code": "11000"
    },
    "age": 30,
    "grades": [83, 88, 89],
    "is_student": false,
    "name": "oeoooeeh",
    "id": "c6884c6b-4f6a-4788-a048-e749ec30793d"
  },
  {
    "address": {
      "city": "orww ok ",
      "zip_code": "00010"
    },
    "age": 30,
    "grades": [85, 90, 86],
    "is_student": false,
    "name": "ehnDoJDo",
    "id": "71884608-2760-4853-8c12-e11149c642cd"
  }
]
```
